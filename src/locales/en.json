      "title": "A BELIEF THAT STARTED IT ALL",
      "text": "The Rabbit School is a Cambodian NGO that began in May 1997 as a pilot project to provide  education to children with special needs at the Nutrition Centre— a government-run orphanage  in Phnom Penh originally established for children aged 0-6 who had been abandoned or lost  their families during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975-1979). In offering education to this  extremely disadvantaged group, The Rabbit School laid the foundation for Cambodia's first  formal educational programs for children with disabilities."

      "text": "What started as a small initiative within an orphanage has grown into a nationally recognized organization dedicated to inclusive education. In 2008, we opened our first integrated classroom within Toul Kork Primary School and launched a Vocational Training Centre in Phnom Penh. These milestones reflected our expanding commitment—not only to education but also to life skills and future employment for children with intellectual disabilities and autism."
