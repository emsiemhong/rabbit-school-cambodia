      "title": "A Belief that Started it All",
      "text": "The Rabbit School is a Cambodian NGO that began in May 1997 as a pilot project to provide  education to children with special needs at the Nutrition Centre— a government-run orphanage  in Phnom Penh originally established for children aged 0–6 who had been abandoned or lost  their families during the Khmer Rouge regime (1975–1979). In offering education to this  extremely disadvantaged group, The Rabbit School laid the foundation for Cambodia’s first  formal educational programs for children with disabilities."

      "title": "Growing with the Community",
      "text": "What started as a small initiative within an orphanage has grown into a nationally recognized organization dedicated to inclusive education. In 2008, we opened our first integrated classroom within Toul Kork Primary School and launched a Vocational Training Centre in Phnom Penh. These milestones reflected our expanding commitment—not only to education but also to life skills and future employment for children with intellectual disabilities and autism."
