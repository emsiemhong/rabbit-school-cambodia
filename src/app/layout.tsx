  to children with special needs at the Nutrition Centreâ€” a government- run orphanage in Phnom Penh originally established for
  children aged 0-6 who had been abandoned or lost their families during the Khmer Rouge regime(1975-1979).In offering education
  to this extremely disadvantaged group, The Rabbit School laid the foundation for Cambodia's first formal educational programs for
  children with disabilities.`
